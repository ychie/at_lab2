Var 2 - Trunk-Based development

Trunk-based development is a software development methodology in which all developers work on a single branch (the trunk), committing their code changes directly to it. In contrast to traditional branching strategies, where developers work on individual feature branches that are eventually merged back into the main branch, trunk-based development keeps the trunk branch as the mainline of development.
